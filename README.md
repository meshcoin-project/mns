### What is MNS
MNS, Meshcoin Name Service, is the domain name service of Meshcoin. It is a distributed, open and extensible naming system based on Meshcoin. The owner can transfer and trade in the form of NFT. MNS interprets readable domain names (such as google.com) into the identifiers that can be recognized by Meshcoin, such as node addresses. MNS serves similar purposes to DNS (Domain Name Service). When getting connected to the network, the users can enter the MNS name, instead of the addressing identification address. MNS will be governed by the community after Meshcoin is launched, and the proceeds from domain name sales will be used for community development.
